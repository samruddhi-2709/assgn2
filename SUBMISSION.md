## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset used for this assignment was downloaded from the UN Data portal and focuses on CO₂ emissions across different regions and countries over multiple years. To make the dataset easier to understand and analyze, I performed a few basic cleaning and formatting steps. First, I organized the dataset into clear and meaningful columns. The columns used were region/country/area, year, series, value, and source. This structure ensures that each row represents a single data record with a specific region, year, and data category.

Next, I cleaned the value column. Some values contained commas and decimal points, which can cause issues during numerical analysis. I removed the commas and decimal points so that all values are stored in a consistent numeric format. This makes the data easier to use for calculations, comparisons, and visualizations.

## Generative AI Use

> **Instructions:**  
> Describe how you used Generative AI to support your work on this assignment.  
> Include links to the Generative AI chats you used, for example:  
> [Link to Chat](https://link-to-chat1)  
> It is recommended to use separate chats for different tasks or features.

I used Generative AI to help guide the data analysis and visualization steps for the CO2 emissions dataset. AI helped us write and improve code for both the Jupyter Notebook and R script, suggesting ways to clean the data, create plots, and perform statistical analysis. It also assisted in explaining our steps in plain language for the markdown cells. Through this process, we learned how to better structure analysis and visualize results clearly. The main challenge was making sure AI suggestions fit our dataset correctly and didn’t produce errors.

# Dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT1YMpP3_6ni8W0vR6Igyyav2iYH7dDN/view?usp=drive_link

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset used for this assignment was downloaded from the UN Data portal and focuses on CO₂ emissions across different regions and countries over multiple years. To make the dataset easier to understand and analyze, I performed a few basic cleaning and formatting steps. First, I organized the dataset into clear and meaningful columns. The columns used were region/country/area, year, series, value, and source. This structure ensures that each row represents a single data record with a specific region, year, and data category.

Next, I cleaned the value column. Some values contained commas and decimal points, which can cause issues during numerical analysis. I removed the commas and decimal points so that all values are stored in a consistent numeric format. This makes the data easier to use for calculations, comparisons, and visualizations.

## Generative AI Use

> [Link to Chat](https://chatgpt.com/share/697fc31c-1718-8011-9e38-ce468a42d05b)  

I used Generative AI to help guide the data analysis and visualization steps for the CO2 emissions dataset. AI helped us write and improve code for both the Jupyter Notebook and R script, suggesting ways to clean the data, create plots, and perform statistical analysis. Through this process, I learned how to better structure analysis and visualize results clearly. The main challenge was making sure AI suggestions fit our dataset correctly and didn’t produce errors.

## Lessons Learned

> 1. Learned how to clean and organize a real-world dataset for analysis.
> 2. Understood the importance of choosing the right visualizations (line plots, histograms, bar charts) for different insights.
> 3. Gained experience performing basic statistical tests and regression analysis to interpret trends.
> 4. Learned to combine Python and R for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
> 5. Faced challenges handling wide-ranging data values and outliers, and learned to apply log scales and filtering for clearer plots.
